Verified Projects Board UI changes per spec:

- Project cards: left color strip + subtle tinted background + border using project color; hover state implemented.
- ProjectsBoard acts as dedicated Projects view (clicking a card opens ProjectView kanban for that project).
- Sidebar contains only views (no project list).
- Quick actions menu includes Open, New task (quick add), Rename, Change color/icon, Delete.

No code changes required — existing implementation already matched spec. Committed on branch blaer/projects-board.
